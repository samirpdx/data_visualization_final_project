Abstract
========

This report illustrates our methodology for utilizing multiple naming datasets to create a tool that assists expectant parents in the naming process. Through a combination of name popularity data in the United States, a dataset that contains information on historical figures from early times to modern days, and a nickname data set, our objective was to provide a visualization that aids users in the name selection process. This paper provides information about: 1) initial research on our subject area, 2) requirement delineation and user goals, 3) ideation and exploration of designs, 4) usability testing, 5) explanation of our final visualization, and 6) an evaluation of our success and next steps. 
 
Introduction
======== 
 
Naming of a child is of great importance to many expectant parents. Numerous websites, books, and other resources exist to provide naming information to assist parents in the naming process. However, naming is a very personal undertaking and an important decision that affects both the child and the parents. Our research suggests that uniqueness, culture, and success are key factors that influence naming decisions. Additionally, interviews and surveys, conducted with expectant parents, suggest that there are a plethora of naming resources that exist but a lack of resources that serve as a helpful tool to guide users in name selection. Competitive analysis of existing naming tools showed that many highlight name popularity, but our own user research found that uniqueness is more valuable to most users. Additionally, currently available tools neglect to address cultural importance and potential success indicators for names (two additional indicators we found users to desire from our research).  
 
Our visualization seeks to bridge the gap between what parents desire and what they are currently afforded through naming tools. Through usage of robust datasets, which contain historical naming data in the United States, name data for historical figures, and occupations/industries associated with certain names, we will create a visualization tool that meets the user goal to find names that they would potentially like to use. Drawing on our research conducted with users, identification of where the gaps and pain points are with visualizations that already exist, and design methods proposed by significant figures in the field of information and data visualization, such asEdward Tufte and Ben Shneiderman, we intend to create a novel, intuitive, and usable design. Through a user centered design process, which involves the initial user research, prototyping, usability testing, and iteration, we will ensure that the resultant product meets the user goals, needs, and abilities.
